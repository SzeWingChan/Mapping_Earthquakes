# Mapping_Earthquakes


## Overview
The Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) is utilized to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data.  

Each earthquake is represented by a circle and specified colour.  In addition, a popup marker that shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake is created for each earthquake.
